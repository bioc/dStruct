Description: dStruct identifies differentially reactive regions from RNA structurome profiling data. dStruct is compatible with a broad range of structurome profiling technologies, e.g., SHAPE-MaP, DMS-MaPseq, Structure-Seq, SHAPE-Seq, etc. See Choudhary et al, Genome Biology, 2019 for the underlying method.
