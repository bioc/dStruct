\title{Calculates d score.}
\usage{
calcDis(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector or matrix.}
}
\value{
If input is a numeric vector, a number is returned. For a matrix, a numeric vector is returned.
}
\description{
\emph{d} score of a nucleotide is a measure of dissimilarity of its
normalized reactivity scores. Consider a transcript and its reactivity profiles
from a group of samples. Then, the \emph{d} score of a nucleotide is \eqn{(2/\pi)}
times the arc-tangent of the ratio of the sample standard deviation of its
reactivities to their mean.
}
\examples{
#Lower standard deviation of reactivites results in lower d-score.
