\title{Plots differentially reactive regions.}
\usage{
plotDStructurome(
  rl,
  diff_regions,

}
\arguments{
\item{rl}{List of dataframes of reactivities for each sample.}

\item{diff_regions}{Dataframe of regions with significance of differentially reactivity.}

\item{outfile}{The name for pdf file which will be saved.}

\item{fdr}{FDR threshold for plotted regions.}

\item{ylim}{Y-axis limits for plots.}

\item{del_d_cutoff}{Minimum effect size for plotted regions specified in terms of median difference of the between-group and within-group d-scores.}
}
\value{
Saves a PDF for all differentially reactive regions. Returns NULL.
